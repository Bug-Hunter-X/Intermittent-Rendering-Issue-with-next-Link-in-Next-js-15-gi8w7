# Intermittent Rendering Issue with next/Link in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates an intermittent rendering issue encountered when using the `next/Link` component to navigate between pages in a Next.js 15 application.  The About page sometimes renders incorrectly, displaying unexpected content or failing to render altogether.  The issue seems to be related to client-side routing and hydration.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the Home page (`http://localhost:3000`).
5. Click the link to navigate to the About page.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 several times; the About page may render incorrectly on some attempts.

## Potential Causes

* **Race conditions:** A potential race condition might exist between client-side rendering and hydration, leading to inconsistent rendering results.
* **State management:** If the application uses any state management solutions, ensure proper hydration is handled.
* **Third-party libraries:** Check for compatibility with the latest version of Next.js.

## Note:
The issue is intermittent, meaning it may not occur every time you try to reproduce it. This makes debugging more challenging.
